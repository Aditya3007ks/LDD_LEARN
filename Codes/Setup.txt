#we must prepare our host and target platforms.

	Host is our laptop , target is board(beagle bone a3 in our case)

#install necessary packages for setup of host machine

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install build-essential lzop u-boot-tools net-tools bison flex libssl-dev libncurses5-dev unzip chrpath xz-utils minicom

#craete empty dir and folder structure for putting code together
	mkdir LDD && CD LDD
	mkdir custom_drivers downloads patches source

#setup target

	to boot our target board, that is, BBB  via the SD card/emmc.
	to boot we need  boot images as well as the root file system. 
	we are going to boot using the pre-built images.
	And after that, we are going to update the kernel by cross-compiling the kernel source, which we are going to a clone from the BeagleBone Repository.

	Partiitonn sd card into 2 : 
		Boot: fs type is FAT16 and file it will hold is MLO, u-boot and kernel image
		RootFileSystem: will be ext4 or ext3 and it will hold debian root file system(we will download it)

	Pre-built images are available here:
		https://github.com/niekiran/linux-device-driver-1/blob/master/downloads/pre-built-images.zip
		download that, and keep that file in your workspace under downloads.

		And after that, extract it. 

		Under this folder, you get another folder called SD boot, and it has pre-built images. 

	Now, we have to download the root file system.

		Now visit BeagleBoard.org and download the latest Debian image for Beaglebone Black 

			Host and target

				You should download the one which is suitable for your board, if you are using beagle bone, then you should be downloading Debian 9.9 2019-08-03 SD IoT.

				This is an image for a pocket beagle, beagle bone, beaglebone black, and wireless, and for so many other boards. Just download this and place it into your download folder.
